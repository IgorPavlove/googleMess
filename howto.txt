# Description
Google is constructing a profile of its users based on a.o. search queries. In an attempt to anonimize your profile, this little script loads a text file, extracts some random search terms, queries google and randomly clicks some results.
Doing automated calls in this way probably conflicts with Google's Terms and Conditions. In addition, I assume that their analytics are good enough to be able to detect this sort of non-human behavior. 
Therefore, this is merely an experiment and this repository mostly for archiving purposes.


# Installation and usage
To run, install python2.x and install mechanize (easiest way: 'pip install mechanize' (select 'pip' during installation of python)).
Usage:
py27googleMess.py -t <text_file>.
Text file can be about anything that you want Google to think you're interested in. Search terms are extracted from this text file at random. 

To simulate your own behavior as much as possible, look for this line in the code:
userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0'
Go to http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ and specify your own user agent string before running the script.

To automate your experiment (e.g. running this script on a regular basis to see if you see any change in your search results in Google, hence tricking Google into thinking that you speak Turkish by using a Turkish text file, for example), I have set this up as a scheduled task in Windows task scheduler. (Hint; doing this with the SYSTEM user allows you to run it in the background, so you don't see the command prompt pop up every time it runs.)
